          <h3 class="fPlayfair fBold">Problem</h3>
            <p class="fMontserrat fRegular">Massachusetts has one of the least accountable state legislatures in the US, leading to a wide gap between voters’ beliefs & the legislature’s priorities&#46; Act on Mass activates grassroots organizers & voters to hold the state legislature accountable to passing a progressive agenda&#46; Act on Mass needed a website to further their reach&#46; Their old website lacked user engagement features&#46; </p>
        </div>
        <div class="solution">
          <h3 class="fPlayfair fBold">Solution</h3>
            <p class="fMontserrat fRegular">The redesigned Actonmass&#46;org aims to create an intuitive experience for users who need information about current progressive bills, need to contact their state legislators, or would like to join volunteer efforts with Act on Mass&#46; </p>

        <div class="comp_ana">
          <h3 class="fPlayfair fBold">Competitive Analysis</h3>
            <p class="fMontserrat fRegular">The goal of the competitive analysis was to study other nonprofit political advocacy organizations, on the state and federal level, and understand the products they produce for the public. I discovered there was not a product on the market that closed the loop from discovery - education - contact elected official.</p>
            <p class="fMontserrat fRegular">There was a legislature search on both of the state level competitors websites. So we knew we needed a search and a summary bio page for each elected official at the state level.</p>
            <p class="fMontserrat fRegular">In terms of bill education the product on the market resembles a list form of bills and small summaries. All of the competitors offered blog features and regular updates. These findings helped shape the MVP and clarify where Act on Mass fit into the market.</p>

          <h3 class="fPlayfair fBold">User Research</h3>
          <p class="fMontserrat fRegular">The first step in redesigning the product was to understand the potential users&#46; Through user surveys and interviews I was able to focus on the key issues and features that were important to users&#46; At this stage in the development I was trying to discern the political issues that motivated the users and what tools they needed to engage with legislators&#46; We used AOM email list to deploy the surveys&#46; I tried to be sensative when asking the demographic questions&#46; One of the questions was “are you married?” I asked this question to gather information about how much time their audeince had to volunteer&#46; Adults with children have less time to volunteer&#46; The question about marriage offended a few people&#46; I could have gathered this information via the question “what are your typical weekend activities?”</p>

We wanted to see how a smaller email collection form tested with users<br><br></h8>
                <h8 class="fMontserrat fRegular">When we were designing the landing page the aim was to briefly educate users about AOM. We also wanted to direct users to the progressive issues. <br><br></h8>
                <h8 class="fMontserrat fRegular">We went back and forth on a design that had more text and information and a leaner design. We also wanted to make sure the CTA was pointing users to sign up for the email list. </h8><br><br>

              <h6 class="fMontserrat fRegular">Issues Page Notes</h6>
              <h8 class="fMontserrat fRegular">AOM current issues pages contain a lot of key information and text. However, it is overloaded with information and it is hard to digest. Also all of their current CTA lead to the same newsletter sign up form. The most important features of the issues pages are the bills that are pushing this issue forward and a brief overview of this issue.</h8><br><br>
              <h8 class="fMontserrat fRegular">AOM current site follows the structure of the challenge, our choice and our power. This is an easy way to follow along with their storyline. We initially worked on wireframes that loosely followed this layout.</h8><br><br>
              <h8 class="fMontserrat fRegular">During user testing of these wireframe sketches we noticed that the placement and style of the bills was going to be critical to get users to click through. </h8>
              <h8 class="fMontserrat fRegular">We also had a lot of users state that they liked the common questions feature on AOM site and would like to be able to still read through them.</h8>
              <h8 class="fMontserrat fRegular">A main issue we worked on throughout the design of the website was the sign up forms. AOM uses HubSpot and there are limitations to the sign up form designs. We wanted to move away from the large sign up form with many fields. However, we ran into issues of having too many small sign up buttons. We tested this in the next round of user testing.</h8>

There is so much information and text on their current website we had to work together to pare down the information into easily digestible chunks. We started this page with a video because that how AOM currently communicates with their audience. </h8><br><br>
                <h8 class="fMontserrat fRegular"> The most important feature on this page is the CTA to get users to ask their elected officials to sign the pledge. The users needed to be educated about what the pledge entails and then ask their reps to sign it.</h8><br><br>
                <h8 class="fMontserrat fRegular">We also wanted to include an interactive map showing all of the elected officials who have signed the pledge. The maps have been a huge hit during their AOM presentations.</h8><br><br>

              <h6 class="fMontserrat fMedium">Bill Page Notes</h6>
                <h8 class="fMontserrat fRegular">The bill page content is at the heart of all of Act on Mass presentations. We took key features from their presentations that were most exciting to their audience and built it into one succinct webpage that tells a story from beginning to end about one bill.</h8><br><br>
                <h8 class="fMontserrat fRegular">The most important features for the bill pages are: a summary of the bill, who are the decision makers, who has co-sponsored this bill, where is this bill during this session, how does the bill process usually work and where is it in that process, and what has happened to this bill in the past.</h8><br><br>
                <h8 class="fMontserrat fRegular">It sounds like a few simple questions to answer but unfortunately the bill process is very complicated and it is hard to place blame on who stopped this bill from going forward. It’s even harder in MA when votes on bills are not automatically recorded. So this led us to distilling the process down into a few chunks that we could show visually. Most voters are unaware of this process and not only need the information but they need to educated along the way. We tried to make every section of this bill page as visual and interactive as possible. We worked with software engineers in tandem so I could design and also make sure it was possible for them to code the backend at the same time.</h8><br><br>
                <h8 class="fMontserrat fRegular">We decide to have a search function so that voters can search their address and the information about the bill becomes personal to their area. The CTA are activated based on what that voter can do. If their representative or senator is a chair or co-chair on the committee in charge their CTA directs them to contact their rep and ask for a vote to be held. If their rep or senator is just on the committee their CTA directs them to ask their official to request a vote.</h8><br><br>

              <h6 class="fMontserrat fMedium">Official Page Notes</h6>
                <h8 class="fMontserrat fRegular">When we talked about the elected official search and summary pages we knew it needed a few key features that the competitors did not offer. Step one the elected official page needed a picture of the rep and their contact information. This is offered by competitors and a basic feature users expected.</h8><br><br>
                <h8 class="fMontserrat fRegular"> Next, the founders really wanted a way for the voters to get in touch with their officials. We talked about a range of buttons and their functions. The most important CTA button was the transparency pledge. The founders wanted it to be very clear which officials signed the pledge and how to contact them to urge officials to sign the pledge. AOM is known for their transparency pledge. It is a stand out feature of their non-profit.</h8><br><br>
                <h8 class="fMontserrat fRegular"> The next feature the founders really wanted was a list of committees each official was on and if they were a chair or co-chair on that committee. They also wanted a CTA button to contact that official to urge them to hold a vote. </h8><br><br>
                <h8 class="fMontserrat fRegular">The next priority on the list was the current bills and if they co-sponsored the bills or not. We discussed having a button to push to direct the user to a list of bills. To prevent making users click through multiple buttons to find this information we decided to keep it all on one page. </h8><br><br>

                <h8 class="fMontserrat fRegular">During the user surveys a majority of participants said they would like to recieve information from Act on Mass via short videos&#46; So we designed the hero sections of each page to hold a video&#46; However, once we tested the new design with the video in the hero section a lot of users complained&#46; Majority of the testers said they just scroll past videos&#46;<br><br></h8>
                <h8 class="fMontserrat fRegular">This particular version of the design had a screengrab from an AOM video&#46; The same screengrab was used as a placeholder for future videos&#46; The reaction to the the video in the hero section may have been because it looked like it was the same video on every page&#46; In the future the correct images will be used and not tested with placeholders because it can skew the testers opinions&#46;<br><br></h8>
                <h8 class="fMontserrat fRegular">The latest design we removed the video in the hero section&#46; We added a relevant image and a short bio about AOM and a button pushing users to their issues section&#46;</h8><br><br>
                <h8 class="fMontserrat fRegular">Some of the testers voiced they did not like the email collection at the top of the webpage. They wanted to know more about the organization before being prompted to sign up&#46; We moved the email gathering form below the hero section and divided the user groups up into two buttons&#46; One button to gather information from users who want to volunteer their time&#46; The "Act Now" button collects information from users who would like to be notified when it's time to contact representatives about votes&#46;</h8>

              <h8 class="fMontserrat fRegular">We moved the Bills section directly below the hero section&#46;The users finding the bills that support each issue is most important&#46; We changed the layout of the bill section so it would stand out more&#46; During the user testing the users would frequently scroll past the bill section&#46;</h8><br><br>
              <h8 class="fMontserrat fRegular">We also changed the method of capturing users emails&#46; We simplified the process and put the form directly on the page instead of using buttons and pop-ups.&#46; We altered the layout of the common questions section to be more user-friendly and not overwhelm the user with a lot fo text&#46;</h8>

                <h8 class="fMontserrat fRegular"> We started the pledge page with a picture of one of the state representatives who has signed the transparency pledge&#46; Some of the feedback we recieved from the user testing was that they wanted to see the faces behind the message&#46; To humanize the cause&#46; The next section was changed to a picture of the actual pledge and a CTA to get the user started&#46; We included the legislator search higher up because we wanted the user to find out if their legislators have signed ASAP&#46; We simplified this webpage a lot and took away a significant amount of text&#46; The website started very text heavy and through user testing and interviews we were able to narrow the focus of what was truly important&#46; One of the last sections on this page is all of the faces of legislators who have signed the pledge&#46; During user testing the users were most excited about the graphics&#46; It is helpful to test products in person&#46;</h8><br><br>

                <h8 class="fMontserrat fRegular">The bill pages are the most important pages on this website&#46; This is the page where most of the education and engagement happen&#46; We again changed the hero section&#46; We included a photo along with three bullet points explaining the bill&#46; During user testing we had users who wanted to be reminded of what the bill's purpose was&#46; We also inclded the breadcrumb in the upper lefthand corner&#46; Users wanted to be able to go back and forth between bills&#46;</h8><br><br>
                <h8 class="fMontserrat fRegular"> The next section is the search for your legislator form&#46; We do not have a sign in function so we are working with the software engineers to find a way to store the data in the users history&#46; Ideally the user will not have to enter their information on each bill&#46; Once the information is entered the buttons will be activated and will push to different actions based on the search result&#46;&#46;</h8><br><br>
                <h8 class="fMontserrat fRegular"> Next is the map of Representatives who co-sponsor this bill&#46; The map toggles between both representatives and senators&#46; The next section is a timeline of this bill during this current session&#46; We decided to have one visual that displayed this current session&#46; The full bill history is displayed as a vertical timeline below&#46;</h8><br><br>
                <h8 class="fMontserrat fRegular">We also decided to include the graphic explaining how the state house works and where the current bill is in the process&#46; A lot of the users reinforced that the edcation component was helpful&#46; The state house legislative process is very complicated and as one user said "a full time job" and Act on Mass is solving that problem for users and providing a product that educates and engages users to hold their legislators accountable&#46;</h8><br><br>
