        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h6>High School</h6><br>
          <p>I took every art class provided in high school. I loved academics but art class was my escape. I daydreamed of going to art school after I graduated. As I approached senior year reality set in that art school was not a practical choice. Instead I packed my bags and headed to New York City to study Politics, Economics, and Philosophy (a much more practical degree.)</p><br>
          <p>As much as I loved art class I also loved to plan. I planned a way to get two years of college done before I even graduated high school. I took every dual credit, AP class and went to community college during the summer.</p><br>
        <h6>College</h6><br>
          <p>After my first year away at college in the big city I decided studying politics, philosophy and economics was not what I wanted to do. However, since I was already so far into my college career (thanks to my excellent planning) I was told by every adult in my life to JUST graduate. Get the degree! It doesn’t matter what it’s in. I already knew I wanted to find a job that exercised my creativity. I missed art class. I did not want to go to law school.</p><br>
        <h6>Post-Grad</h6><br>
          <p>So I graduated with my PPE degree and had no idea what to do with my life. What should I do now? I worked as a nanny while I tried to figure out what was next. One day I got a text from one of the parents I worked for. He is an amazing product designer and the company he worked for was hiring an office manager. It was the perfect job for me!</p><br>
        <h6>First Job</h6><br>
          <p>I started my new job at a luxury lifestyle brand. I worked directly with the art director, the founder of the company, and the VP of global sales. I got to see how products came to life through inspiration. I followed the creation of these products from ideas to marketed campaigns. I loved the collaboration it took for everyone to successfully launch the story of the products.</p><br>
          <p>Of all the departments I worked with I really loved working with the art director. I worked with her on the company’s web design and print design. Often I was the person doing the spot checking for inconsistencies in price books or throughout our new website. She taught me how to look at work critically. This is when I realized I could be analytical and creative. I could pursue being a designer.</p><br><br>
