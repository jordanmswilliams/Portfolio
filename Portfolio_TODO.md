14. project1 > user research > user personas
    I have a second user persona. I would like the user persona to be clickable to see the second user persona.
15. project1 > sticky_nav
      each link is in hover state while scrolling through that section. So user can easily glance at what section they are in.
16. project1 > branding > Icons "TO_DO_16"
      place the icons and parallelogram in a grid.
