HIGH priority
22. (Jordan & Robin - HIGH priority)
    Look at Firefox Inspect tool for ability to render different media formats
41. link the buttons on index.html to the about me page and the case study
44. header_distributed add :hover state for links .gallery , .about
46. project1.html > user personas
    Add circle and quote
51. Home Page - too much ' white ' space
59. Tighten Gallery and About together
61. Make logo a little smaller
63. Header feels a little sparse
71. Go through and change H tags
72. project1 > testing & prototypes > file upload , dashboard, doc editor,     landing page

LOW priority
7. (Jordan - low priority)
  Make the quad graph a responsive CSS drawing.
    - D: I don't know what this means. Can you explain?
20. Add third carousel item to project1.html
21. Move head and footer to include files (to reduce need to maintain them separately on each HTML page)
1. Case study main body uses .section -> change to .section_CS for future (for continuity when adding further pages)
45. project1.html > user personas > carousel
    change to click for next persona instead of auto rotate. The rotation isn't long enough to read information. I won't have to necessarily create a third persona if it's clickable instead of auto rotate.
47. Gallery vs. Portfolio
49. Might take a swing at fixing the line drawing from the footer in a group session
