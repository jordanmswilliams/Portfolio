          <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>We all have images, folders, documents and much more on our computer. 1.8 billion people use a cloud storage service to store this content. There are multiple cloud storage services available but they have clunky dashboards and lack the ability to easily save content from the web. Most of these services do not offer a way to tag and easily search content. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="solution">
          <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>Dream Space aims to create an intuitive experience for users who need to gather inspiration, organize their thoughts and content in projects, and collaborate with team members all in one place. The user has the ability to save content (from the web or via uploads), categorize it with tags, and store it into a project where team members can chat and place comments. </p>

          <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
            <p>An analysis of market competitors Pinterest, Dropbox and Box found that there was an opening in the market for a product that combined the features of Pinterest and Dropbox. Dreamspace has the ability to organize your files visually combined with the collaboration and file storage features of Dropbox. </p>

          <h3>User Research</h3>
          <p>The first step in creating this cloud storage platform was to understand the potential user. Through user surveys and interviews I was able to focus on the key features that were important to users. At this stage in development I was trying to figure out if the client’s idea was going to be fruitful and if so, what were the specific features we needed to stand out against the competition.</p>

            <p>The user stories were turned into user flows. User flows layout how a user would navigate through the platform.  Working through the user flows sets up the roadmap for the website. The flow of creating documents, files or folders changed as the design evolved. I learned that it is crucial to map out each user flow so time is not lost redesigning the website.</p><br><br>

            <p>User testing the low-fi wireframes provided valuable feedback that shaped the high-fidelity wireframes.  The most significant change was to the onboarding process. The user testing indicated that the onboarding process needed to be simplified.</p>

            <p>A usability test script was created and six users tested the hi-fi wireframes. Overall, the users had greater success with the new simpler onboarding process.</p>

            <p>The next challenge encountered was the ability to create content and upload files. Users had some trouble finding the correct buttons. These buttons were modified in the next round of mockups.</p><br><br>

            <p>Before starting the mockups the branding needed to be established. This included fonts, colors and designing a logo. The mood of Dream Space is playful. Dream Space needed to appeal to creatives. Dream Space is built around the color blue. The accent colors and the playfulness of the illustrations set Dream Space apart from the competition. The fonts, Archivo Black Regular and Roboto, were chosen to because of their contrast and versatility. </p>
